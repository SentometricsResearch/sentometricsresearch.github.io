&lt;p&gt;Update of the Media Climate Change Concerns (MCCC) index! The index ranges now from January 2003 to June 2025. The MCCC is constructed from major U.S. newspapers and newswires to proxy for climate change concerns. Check our work published at Management Science for details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have extended the MCCC index and its subindices (topical and thematic) beyond their updated timeframe of 2003 to June 2024, now encompassing data up to June 2025. This update provides one year of additional data, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of media coverage of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No methodological change was required for this update (for the changes compared to the original index, see the 2023 update)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope this update will enhance the utility of the Media Climate Change Concerns Index, empowering academic researchers and industry practitioners to gain deeper insights into the evolving landscape of media coverage of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please refer to this article when using the index in your research:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have extended the MCCC index and its subindices (topical and thematic) beyond their updated timeframe of 2003 to August 2022, now encompassing data up to June 2024. This update provides approximately two years of additional data, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of media coverage of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No methodological change was required for this update (for the changes compared to the original index, see the 2023 update)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>2023 Update on the Media Climate Change Concerns Index</title>

&lt;p&gt;Update of the Media Climate Change Concerns (MCCC) index! The index ranges now from January 2003 to August 2022. The MCCC is constructed from major U.S. newspapers and newswires to proxy for climate change concerns. Check our work published at Management Science for details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have extended the MCCC index and its subindices (topical and thematic) beyond their original timeframe of 2003 to June 2018, now encompassing data up to August 2022. This update provides approximately four years of additional data, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of media coverage of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To ensure consistency and accuracy, we have diligently followed the same procedure used to generate the original dataset while accounting for necessary changes in methodology for the new data (from July 2018 to August 2022).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to highlight a few key points regarding the update process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Exclusion of The Houston Chronicle: Unfortunately, the research team no longer has access to The Houston Chronicle and therefore, it is not included in the updated index.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Use of Alternative News Aggregators: For the remaining newspapers, we relied on alternative news aggregators to obtain the data for some of them, ensuring that the coverage is as comprehensive as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Upgrade to LIWC2022 Software: Due to the unavailability of the LIWC2015 software, we utilized the LIWC2022 software to compute the concerns score of the new documents. It is important to note that although we used the 2015 dictionary within the 2022 software, we observed slight differences in the concerns scores generated by both software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To assess the impact of these changes, we conducted a thorough analysis using one year of overlapping data. By generating new indices and computing correlations with the original indices, we found that the correlation was consistently above 0.95 for all indices. This suggests that the methodological changes implemented during the update did not fundamentally invalidate the updated data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the topical and thematic indices, we used the same model trained with 2003-2018 data to compute the topicality of the updated indices. This approach ensures continuity in the topical model, allowing for meaningful comparisons between the new and previous data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope this update will enhance the utility of the Media Climate Change Concerns Index, empowering academic researchers and industry practitioners to gain deeper insights into the evolving landscape of media coverage of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Update to the Belgian (French and Dutch) EPU Index</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We have made an update to the Belgian Economic Policy Uncertainty index.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This update makes the index much more localized to Belgium and thus less affected by international events (that have no impact on Belgium). Moreover, we have made some changes that take into account some specificity of the dutch language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, this results in a more aligned and correlated French- and Dutch-specific EPU index. This update also eliminates unwarranted disparities between the EPU index of each language.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Century of Economic Policy Uncertainty Through the French-Canadian Lens</title>
      <link>/post/2102-epu-quebec/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 02 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/post/2102-epu-quebec/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Leveraging a historical French-Canadian newspaper data set provided by the Bibliothèque et Archives Nationales du Québec (BAnQ)
as well as a research collaboration with Radio-Canada, we have developed a century-long historical Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU) index for the Canadian province of Quebec.
In addition to providing a long historical view of the Quebec economy via the EPU,
this index complements the already available Canadian EPU by focusing on French-Canadian sources, which were notably a missing component of the index.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When looking over our 100-year time horizon, three peaks are particularly large: (i)
the Great Depression, (ii) the 2008 financial crisis, and (iii) the COVID-19 pandemic.
Moreover, the index tends to be higher post-war and during some other events such as
the patriation of the Canadian constitution in 1982 (a national event) or the Oka crisis in
1990 (a Quebec-specific event). More events are annotated in the figure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our data set and the historical aspect of our index raise some challenges. First, the archives of several news sources are grouped by issue rather than by individual articles,
which renders the standard EPU count impossible. Second, archives&#39; availability for particular media sources differs over time, making the static-window standardization
used in the traditional sources’ aggregation biased. As such, we propose a novel token-distance-based triple approach to identify EPU mentions in
textual documents and use a dynamic normalization for the sources’ aggregation to address these problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the note accompanying the index, we show that our index outperforms the existing Canadian EPU when
nowcasting major Canadian and Quebec macroeconomic variables.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Media Climate Change Concerns Index</title>

&lt;p&gt;Many consider climate change as one of the biggest challenges of our times. However, there is disagreement on the magnitude of the climate change problem and how to solve it. Conditional on their view on the issue, some people may have a high preference for sustainable solutions and investments tackling the climate change problem, while others may not. Moreover, these preferences can evolve on the arrival of new information. In general, preference for sustainable solutions is largely a function of how concerned people are about climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discerning concerns about climate change in almost real-time can be useful for many applications, particularly asset pricing. The theoretical model proposed by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nber.org/papers/w26549&#34;&gt;Pastor et al. (2020)&lt;/a&gt; implies that the returns of green stocks vs. the returns of brown stocks are a function of the unexpected changes in climate change concerns. In particular, when there is an unexpected increase in climate change concerns, green stocks outperform brown stocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, an issue is that the level of concern about climate change cannot be observed and needs to be proxied. This fact renders the analysis of the dynamics of climate change concerns more complicated than the analysis of observable macroeconomic variables such as GDP growth. Here, we propose an index derived from major U.S newspapers to proxy for change in climate change concerns. Our corpus, or set of news articles, about climate change to derive this index can be summarized in multiple topics and themes, for which the most representative words are shown below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;topics.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To build our indices, we first propose a concern score: A combination of the level of risk and the sentiment expressed in news media articles. We then compute the concerns score for all news articles about climate change in the corpus. Finally, we aggregate those concerns score into a daily index. We explicitly consider the news media’s attention to climate change during the news articles’ concerns score aggregation process. Indeed, there is a higher probability of the true change in climate change concerns when there is both concerning news articles and a high media attention level.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The added advantage of text- and news-based measures as sources of information for forecasting and assessing the economy is significant. In a recent paper of ours, we present a general methodology, which constitutes the base of the sentometrics R package, to forecast economic variables from news data. In this project, we have computed several US news sentiment indicator for many topics relevant to the US economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To encourage research in this area, we share daily sentiment estimates for those economic topics. We estimate the daily sentiment with several lexicon-based methods. The daily sentiment for each topic is reported from 1993 to 2016. We note that missing dates in the dataset means that no news articles were available at that date.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Economic Policy Uncertainty Index for Flanders, Wallonia and Belgium</title>
      <link>/post/2009-epu-index/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 25 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/post/2009-epu-index/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU) measures the economic risk when the government policy&amp;rsquo;s future path is uncertain. This index can detect events and trends which correlate, for instance, with economic health and stock market downturns. This post showcase the Economic Policy Uncertainty for Belgium, which is divided into two parts: The Flander EPU and the Walloon EPU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EPU index is derived daily from significant newspapers in french and dutch published in Belgium beginning January 2001 and &lt;strong&gt;kept up to date daily on our home page&lt;/strong&gt;. In particular, we report a 30-day moving average of the daily index. The general idea behind the EPU index&amp;rsquo;s construction is to detect news articles that contain triplets of words: One related to the Economy, one related to Policy, and one related to Uncertainty. These keywords are defined using a combination of expert opinion and Natural Language Processing methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the monthly index for Belgium zoomed-in from January 2020 to May 2020, which includes the start of the COVID-19 pandemic to showcase the power of the Economic Policy Uncertainty Index.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;coronaEPU.png&#34; alt=&#34;EPU during coronavirus&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dynamics are interesting. January and February are calm months with a level around 100, which indicates the same degree of uncertainty as on average up to 2011. After that, the uncertainty unequivocally drives up, becomes more volatile transitioning from March to April, and decreasing in the last three weeks of April. Most of the uncertainty increased before the lockdown in Belgium was officially imposed. The uncertainty remains high in May, but at a fairly constant, and lower, daily level.&lt;/p&gt;
